# About project

This repository is created by Konstantin Lukyanenok as test task from [iLink company](https://ilink.dev){target="_blank"}. I had to develop a page using Figma layout  with some information about me. There should be a carousel of reviews with pagination and a possibility to make new review. I had to show that all form data can be send (alert with data), all buttons should be usable. There should be a form fields validation. I've made checking two words as a name and a surname, minimum 50 and max 200 chars as a review text and a progibition for sending file biger than 1Mb. I've let sending invalid form only for showing speshial messages about a successful or unsuccessful sending. Using any UI libraries has been prohibited.
